# Comp3111LEx - Maven Project

## Project Overview
This is a Maven-based Java project created for the COMP3111 Software Engineering course. It involves setting up a local Git repository, pushing the project to GitHub, and implementing basic Java functionalities.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Java SDK**: Ensure JDK 21 is installed.
2. **IntelliJ IDEA**: Use IntelliJ to create the project using Maven as the build tool.
3. **Git Integration**: Enable Git version control within IntelliJ and push the project to a remote GitHub repository.

## Key Features
- Java source code in `src/main/java`.
- JUnit setup for testing (`org.junit.jupiter`).
- Version control enabled with Git, commits pushed to GitHub.

## Comments
- **Project Creation**: I followed the steps to create a Maven project in IntelliJ. The folder structure and `pom.xml` file were generated automatically, which simplified the process.
- **JUnit Dependency**: Adding the JUnit dependency via Maven worked well. IntelliJ made it easy to search for and include the latest version.
- **Git Integration**: I enabled Git for version control and linked it to my GitHub repository. This was straightforward thanks to IntelliJâ€™s built-in support.
- **Commit Process**: After writing the code, I made two commits:
    1. Initial commit with basic Java classes.
    2. Second commit after adding two print statements in the `mainApp1` class for testing.
- **Project Build**: The project builds without any errors, and I was able to run it successfully. Debugging features in IntelliJ helped in identifying and fixing syntax issues.
